## Phases

<details>
<summary>✅ v7.0 — Souper homebrew mapper (phases 21–22) — CLOSED LOCALLY 2026-11-14</summary>

- [x] Phase 21: Measured milestone tune-up (1/1 plan) — completed 2026-11-13; TUNE-11 verified.
- [x] Phase 22: Complete Souper homebrew mapper (4/4 plans) — completed 2026-11-14; SOUPER-01 through SOUPER-07 verified.

All five plans have summaries. Native integration found and closed the loaded-module test gap; the final verifier, integration review and local gates passed. One `unknown` workspace record was acknowledged as deferred, with 49 earlier acknowledgments carried forward. See the [milestone audit](milestones/v7.0-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md) for evidence and environment limits.

## Next boundary

v7.0 is locally complete and archived. No successor scope is selected; use
`$gsd-new-milestone` for recommendation-first discussion. The owner has
preauthorized normal publication, PR merge and the CI/release automation they
trigger at natural delivery points. Original Phase 12/14 stops, the nine deferred
v3.0 requirements and unaccepted hardware/platform claims remain unchanged.
